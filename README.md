# PlainJS Checklist
My take on Exercise 10 of Wes Bos' JavaScript30 [series](https://javascript30.com/), whose goal is to build deeper understanding of JavaScript by refraining from use of opinionated programming paradigms or frameworks in place of a simple focus on core concepts using plain JS.

## About
This app consists of an item checklist rendered on a notepad. The user is able to cross items of the list by ticking the corresponding box, with a key feature being the ability to use the `Shift` key to cross off multiple items at a time.

To make the exercise more challenging, I decided to also implement the ability to 'uncomplete' several items at a time, by `Shift`-clicking across multiple crossed-off items.

## How to run
